# CitiBike-Monthly-Report
Here is an example of Python program using Google Colab to automate the data preparation of monthly Citi Bike data. The program can read the zip file directly from the Citi Bike online portal, and process the data to report the total number of Citi Bike trips for each calendar day. The users only need to provide the URL of the data file that they want to process, and download/save the results to their local computers at the end.

Refer to this Medium article that breaks down the code step by step:
